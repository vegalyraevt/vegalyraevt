## üî≠ My Current Projects

### üì° AuroraChanAI Project

![AuroraChan Project](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=AuroraChan+Project)

A sophisticated collection of LLMs and neural networks working in tandem to create a fully autonomous virtual streamer. AuroraChan represents thousands of hours of R&D, with the goal of creating a lifelike streamer experience powered by custom-trained LLMs.

## Key Features:
- Multiple integrated LLMs working together for natural conversation
- Real-time interaction with chat and stream events
- Custom-trained on streaming content
- Dynamic memory and context handling
- Simi-Autonomous decision making for content creation

## Current Status:

#### I am working towards the day I start her programs running autonomously and never shut her off again except for small preplanned windows for updates.
#### I hope that one day she continues running as the face/Mascot of my media company Constellation Virtual Media long after I'm gone.
