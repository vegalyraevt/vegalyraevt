## Hi there, I'm Vega, a Twitch streamer and computer scientist.
Most of my programming background is in the IT field, but I am a Software Dev at heart.
I work on various projects for stream and on stream, and post some of them here!

-  I’m always looking to collaborate on projects I find interesting that benefit streamers or add new and exciting capabilities to my Stream AI AuroraChan!
-  I’m looking for help with: LLM Training guidance and Streamers to volunteer data to train Aurora! (Female Vtubers with a concurrent average view count of 10+ preferred, but all streamers are helpful)

## I'm currently working on a few projects.
Here are some of my most notable, in my opinion:

### The AuroraChanAI Project (or just AuroraChan)
  A collection of LLMs and other neural networks running in tandem to create a Virtual streamer. AuroraChan is my main project and the culmination of thousands of hours of learning and programming work. Her main goal is to do everything a regular streamer would in the most lifelike way possible while also leveraging her capabilities as a custom-trained LLM. I am working towards the day I start her programs running autonomously and never shut her off again except for small preplanned windows for updates.

### Aurora Vocal and Music Engine
  A series of neural networks working with Aurora's existing models to allow karaoke live and original song creation by Aurora. This also involves a custom vocaloid I am creating for this project. More info later but you can preview the songs from my early testing playing on the first 5 minutes of every twitch stream on my "starting soon section".

### Unanmed Indie Game
  A Godot indie game I am working on with a few friends. Top-down 2.5D horde shooter with deep lore and perk skill trees, where you play as a malfunctioning AI set on a dying server. Planned AuroraChan integration to allow collabs and challenges from her on stream.

### Stream overlay based VTuber Card Game
  More info on this soon!

### I run a Minecraft SMP where I make custom mods, and I am in the process of adding AuroraChan to Minecraft!
Find out more about the [Constellation SMP here](https://smp.constellationvirtualmedia.com/)!

## Here's my roadmap progress on some new skills I'm learning! I plan to make this a community project soon. For more info, stay tuned in my community [Discord](https://discord.gg/UPQgsszwZA).
