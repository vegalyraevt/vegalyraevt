## üî≠ Featured Projects

<details>
<summary><strong>üì° AuroraChanAI Project</strong></summary>
<br>
A sophisticated collection of LLMs and neural networks working in tandem to create a fully autonomous virtual streamer. AuroraChan represents thousands of hours of R&D, with the goal of creating a lifelike streamer experience powered by custom-trained LLMs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üéµ Aurora Vocal and Music Engine</strong></summary>
<br>
Neural networks enabling live karaoke and original song creation by Aurora. This project includes a custom vocaloid implementation. Preview songs play during the first 5 minutes of each Twitch stream. Please note this is not AI generated music but instead a workspace tool I use to allow aurora to view and make requests about songs I make with a vocaloid program I work in.
