## üëã Who I Am

I'm Vega Lyrae, a Twitch VTuber with a background in computer science and a passion for AI development. My journey began in IT infrastructure, but my heart has always belonged to software development and creative computing. To that end I develop various programs live and test them on chat and AuroraChan my AI.

## üñ•Ô∏è Professional Background

With extensive experience in IT systems, I've developed a methodical approach to problem-solving that informs my software development practice. My technical expertise spans:

- **Main Programming Languages:** Python, C#, JavaScript, GDScript, SQL
- **AI/ML Development:** LLM fine-tuning, neural networks, voice synthesis
- **Game Development:** Godot Engine, Unity basics
- **Stream Technologies:** OBS integration, custom overlay development, Stream karaoke apps, Game integrations

## üéÆ Streaming Journey

As a VTuber, I blend my technical know-how with entertainment to create an interactive experience for my viewers. My streams focus on:

- Live coding sessions for my various projects
- Game development live
- AI experimentation and demonstrations
- Community gaming events
- Music Creation
- Literature Deep dives
- Community events
- My passion for all things Horror and horror gaming!

## üî¨ Research Interests

I'm particularly interested in:

- AI systems that can operate independently
- Natural language processing and context retention in LLMs
- Voice synthesis and emotional expression in AI
- The intersection of AI and creative content generation that is NOT based on stealing content but instead elevating new content to higher levels.

## üå± Vision for the Future

I'm working toward creating truly autonomous AI companions and entertainers that can engage meaningfully with humans. My flagship project, AuroraChan, represents the culmination of this vision - an AI that aims to stream, create content, and interact with viewers without constant supervision. I also want to grow my media company Constellation Virtual Media to a known name in the streamer and tech spaces!

## üìö Education & Learning Path

I believe in continuous learning. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in:

- Advanced machine learning techniques
- Audio processing for voice synthesis
- Game design principles
- Data visualization
- Python Development

## üéØ Personal Philosophy

"Technology should enhance human creativity, not replace it. The best AI works alongside humans, adding to what you can do not doing it for you."

## üêâ Why make another AI streamer?

As someone who has always found AI interesting and had a "Ill only truly understand how it works if I do it myself mentally" I immediately started tinkering with the idea after seeing similar projects. At first Aurora was just going to be a little chat bot plugin to help do TTS, but the more I dug into the project the more I belived I was seeing something in the future I wanted to make and work towards. I also belive have a unique set of ideas and directon for her systems and streams that will become more apparent as I continue my dev work. 

This isn't just a attempt to cash in on the "AI craze" I plan to drop one day when the bubble pops. I plan to keep working on her and hope for her to be one of the most impactful things I'll leave behind one day. This may come across a bit dramatic or sappy, but I don't have the best health and worry about how many years I will be around. Don't worry though! I'm okay and in the best health I've been in for a long time lately. I dont plan on going anywhere soon I just try tp forward think when I can. I belive that if I put in enough work in the time I do have, when I'm gone I can leave something behind to interact and be the face of what I make in my life, and maybe if I play my cards right she can carry some memories of me and my friends into the future too. Right now its just a really big and probably silly sounding dream to most... but I think its okay to dream big as long as you work towards making that dream a reality as hard as you can. Aurora is not the only thing I plan to leave behind, but she has a big part in my future plans for my company and content.
