## 👋 Who I Am

I'm Vega Lyrae, a Twitch VTuber with a background in **Mechatronics and Computer Science** and a passion for AI and robotics. My journey began in IT infrastructure, but my heart has always belonged to software development and creative computing. To that end, I develop various programs live on stream, from AI companions like AuroraChan to new voice synthesis frameworks like the ALIZARIN Engine.

I am currently pursuing a **dual bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering and Computer Science**, and I hope to continue on to a master's or PhD in the future.

## 🖥️ Professional Background

With extensive experience in IT systems, I've developed a methodical approach to problem-solving that informs my software development practice. My technical expertise spans:

- **Main Programming Languages:** Python, C#, JavaScript, GDScript, SQL
- **AI/ML Development:** LLM fine-tuning, neural networks, voice synthesis
- **Game Development:** Godot Engine, Unity basics
- **Stream Technologies:** OBS integration, custom overlay development, Stream karaoke apps, Game integrations
- **Robotics:** ROS, Control Systems, PLC Programming

## 🎮 Streaming Journey

As a VTuber, I blend my technical know-how with entertainment to create an interactive experience for my viewers. My streams focus on:

- Live coding sessions for my various projects
- Live robotics development and testing
- Game development live
- AI experimentation and demonstrations
- Community gaming events
- Music Creation
- Literature Deep dives
- Community events
- My passion for all things Horror and horror gaming!

## 🔬 Research Interests

I'm particularly interested in:

- AI systems that can operate independently
- Natural language processing and context retention in LLMs
- Voice synthesis and emotional expression in AI
- Algorithmic and formant-based synthesis for creating 100% synthetic voices
- The intersection of AI and creative content generation that is NOT based on stealing content but instead elevating new content to higher levels.

## 🌱 Vision for the Future

My vision is twofold:

1.  **For AI Companions:** I am working to create truly autonomous AI companions like **AuroraChan**, who can engage meaningfully with humans, create content, and interact with viewers without constant supervision.
2.  **For Ethical Tools:** I am developing the **ALIZARIN Engine** as an open-source, ethical voice framework. My goal is to provide creators with powerful, free tools to author their own unique, 100% synthetic voices, offering a clear alternative to the trend of unauthorized AI voice cloning.

Through both projects, I aim to grow my media company, Constellation Virtual Media, into a known name in the streamer and tech spaces.

## 📚 Education & Learning Path

I believe in continuous learning. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in:

- Advanced machine learning techniques
- Audio processing for voice synthesis
- Game design principles
- Data visualization
- Python Development

## 🎯 Personal Philosophy

"Technology should enhance human creativity, not replace it. The best AI works alongside humans, adding to what you can do not doing it for you."

## 🐉 Why make another AI streamer?

As someone who has always found AI interesting and had a "Ill only truly understand how it works if I do it myself mentally" I immediately started tinkering with the idea after seeing similar projects. At first Aurora was just going to be a little chat bot plugin to help do TTS, but the more I dug into the project the more I belived I was seeing something in the future I wanted to make and work towards. I also belive have a unique set of ideas and directon for her systems and streams that will become more apparent as I continue my dev work. 

This isn't just a attempt to cash in on the "AI craze" I plan to drop one day when the bubble pops. I plan to keep working on her and hope for her to be one of the most impactful things I'll leave behind one day. This may come across a bit dramatic or sappy, but I don't have the best health and worry about how many years I will be around. Don't worry though! I'm okay and in the best health I've been in for a long time lately. I dont plan on going anywhere soon I just try tp forward think when I can. I belive that if I put in enough work in the time I do have, when I'm gone I can leave something behind to interact and be the face of what I make in my life, and maybe if I play my cards right she can carry some memories of me and my friends into the future too. Right now its just a really big and probably silly sounding dream to most... but I think its okay to dream big as long as you work towards making that dream a reality as hard as you can. Aurora is not the only thing I plan to leave behind, but she has a big part in my future plans for my company and content.

## ⚙️ Why create a synthetic voice engine?

The ALIZARIN Engine is my answer to a major ethical problem in the AI space. While I love working on generative AI, I see a clear and urgent need for tools that are not "based on stealing content."

My philosophy for this engine is **"no human inside"** building on the framwork made by missile39 for Adachi Rei. It is designed to create new, stylized voices from the ground up using algorithms and synthesis, not by sampling or cloning a human. This, most importantly, fufils my desire to work withing the niche retro synth voice utau space I have been fascinated with since finding out about them.  This also provides a free, open-source, and high-quality path for anyone (hobbyist or commercial) to have a unique synthetic retro voice. I hope this also give poeple intrested in having their own voices that can't sing a way to enter the space *without* feeliong the need to "steal" or repurpose an existing human voice. It's my attempt to build a creative alternative that respects voice actors and fosters originality and unique voies.
