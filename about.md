## üëã Who I Am

I'm Vega Lyrae, a Twitch VTuber with a background in computer science and a passion for AI development. My journey began in IT infrastructure, but my heart has always belonged to software development and creative computing. To that end I develop various programs live and test them on chat and AuroraChan my AI.

## üñ•Ô∏è Professional Background

With extensive experience in IT systems, I've developed a methodical approach to problem-solving that informs my software development practice. My technical expertise spans:

- **Main Programming Languages:** Python, C#, JavaScript, GDScript, SQL
- **AI/ML Development:** LLM fine-tuning, neural networks, voice synthesis
- **Game Development:** Godot Engine, Unity basics
- **Stream Technologies:** OBS integration, custom overlay development, Stream karaoke apps, Game integrations

## üéÆ Streaming Journey

As a VTuber, I blend my technical know-how with entertainment to create an interactive experience for my viewers. My streams focus on:

- Live coding sessions for my various projects
- Game development live
- AI experimentation and demonstrations
- Community gaming events
- Music Creation
- Literature Deep dives
- Community events
- and my passion for all things Horror and horror gaming!

## üî¨ Research Interests

I'm particularly interested in:

- AI systems that can operate independently
- Natural language processing and context retention in LLMs
- Voice synthesis and emotional expression in AI
- The intersection of AI and creative content generation that is NOT based on stealing content but instead elevating new content to higher levels.

## üå± Vision for the Future

I'm working toward creating truly autonomous AI companions and entertainers that can engage meaningfully with humans. My flagship project, AuroraChan, represents the culmination of this vision - an AI that aims to stream, create content, and interact with viewers without constant supervision. I also want to grow my media company COnstellation Virtual Media to a known name in the streamer and tech spaces!

## üìö Education & Learning Path

I believe in continuous learning. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in:

- Advanced machine learning techniques
- Audio processing for voice synthesis
- Game design principles
- Data visualization
- Python Development

## üéØ Personal Philosophy

"Technology should enhance human creativity, not replace it. The best AI works alongside humans, adding to what you can do not doing it for you."
