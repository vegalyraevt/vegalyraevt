## üíñ Ways to Support

Your support enables me to continue developing Aurora's AI technologies, creating content, and sharing my work with the community. Aurora actually costs more to run monthly than I have ever made streaming. So any support is GREATLY apreciated and helps to keep her running and expand her cabilities. The best support is just watching and encouraging me if you enjoy my content or interacing with AuroraChan! Here are several additional ways you can help further if you desire though:

### üéÅ Ko-fi
